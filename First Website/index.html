            <dl style="background-color: rgb(38, 123, 180); border: solid; border-color: darkorange;">
                <dt>Kumate Tribe</dt>
                <dd>The Kumate Tribe are a violent and isolated race of humans that have cannibalistic tendencies, having no issue with eating humans from outside their own tribe. What sets them apart from other humans physically is their silver hair and identical noses. They all dress identically and wear triangular face paint. They live on their own island in East Blue.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt>Kuja Tribe</dt>
                <dd>The Kuja are a race of humans that are physically identical to regular humans in every way, however they are unique in that they have a natural aptitude for using Haki, along with a mysterious bond with snakes and that they only give birth to females. They are a race of warrior people who live on Amazon Lily and are ruled by Boa Hancock. Much like regular humans, they have very varied appearances and sizes, even among family members, and a few may even have animal-like features.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt>Torino Tribe</dt>
                <dd>The Torino people[1] are a race of short and rotund humans, only being around 1.2 meters in height, that hail from the Torino Kingdom in South Blue. While they dress primitively and live a simple hunter/gatherer lifestyle, they are actually very advanced in the field of medicine, even having a library dedicated to cataloging their medical findings, and they can also create missile launcher-like spears. They were once at war with the giant Goayu Birds that ruled their island before Tony Tony Chopper brought peace between them.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt>World Nobles</dt>
                <dd>The World Nobles are the descendants of the founders of the World Government. They are ordinary humans in every way, but because of their powerful political status, almost all of them believe themselves to be gods with no relation to their fellow man (or any other race for that matter), who they see as lesser beings to be used for their own amusement or as slaves, with Donquixote Homing and Mjosgard being the only one not displaying the mindset. Because they think they are above other humans, they live isolated from the rest of the world in the land of Mary Geoise so as not to breathe the "tainted" air of their lessers. When interacting with the outside world, they wear protective suits which supply them with purified air despite the regular air doing them no harm.</dd>
