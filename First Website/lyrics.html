            Will you hold the line
            When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
            In this house of mine
            Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
            Will the stars align?
            Will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin, will it?
            'Cause this house of mine stands strong

            That's the price you pay
            Leave behind your heart and cast away
            Just another product of today
            Rather be the hunter than the prey

            And you're standing on the edge face up
            'Cause you're a natural
            A beating heart of stone
            You gotta be so cold
            To make it in this world
            Yeah, you're a natural
            Living your life cutthroat
            You gotta be so cold
            Yeah, you're a natural

            Will somebody
            Let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing?
            What's happening?
            Looking through the glass find the wrong within the past knowing
            Oh, we are the youth
            Cut until it bleeds inside a world without the peace, face it
            A bit of the truth, the truth

            That's the price you pay
            Leave behind your heart and cast away
            Just another product of today
            Rather be the hunter than the prey

            And you're standing on the edge face up
            'Cause you're a natural
            A beating heart of stone
            You gotta be so cold
            To make it in this world
            Yeah, you're a natural
            Living your life cutthroat
            You gotta be so cold
            Yeah, you're a natural

            Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
            Took an oath by the blood on my hand, won't break it
            I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
            Gonna make it
            I'm gonna make it

            Natural
            A beating heart of stone
            You gotta be so cold
            To make it in this world

            Yeah, you're a natural
            Living your life cutthroat
            You gotta be so cold
            Yeah, you're a natural

            Natural

            Yeah, you're a natural
